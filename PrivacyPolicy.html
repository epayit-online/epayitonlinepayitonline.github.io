                        (the “Privacy Policy”) explaining our online information practices. The Privacy

                        entire Privacy Policy (set forth below) and contact us if you have any questions

                    </p>
                    <strong>COLLECTION AND TRACKING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
                    <p>
                        In order that we can ensure that you receive the services offered by the Site, we
                        request and use a limited amount of information about you including your name, email
                        address, street address, zip code, certain medical account information, and a truncated
                        portion of your social security number. Some of the information we possess about
                        you is Protected Health Information (as defined under the Health Insurance Portability
                        and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and such information is only shared in
                        conformance with HIPAA. We also may collect other information when you visit the
                        Site such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring
                        Web site address. This information (the information we collect and receive about
                        you is referred to, collectively, as “User Information”) is collected both during
                        registration on the Site and when the Site is visited.
                    </p>
                    <strong>WHAT WE DO WITH USER INFORMATION</strong>
                    <p>
                        We use the User Information to deliver the electronic communications, for authentication
                        purposes, and for controlling and monitoring use of the Site. We also use the User
                        Information to evaluate and administer our services and respond to any problems
                        that may arise. We do not sell, trade, or rent User Information to third parties
                        and will not disclose personal information separately identifying you, without prior
                        consent, except as set forth herein.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may disclose certain User Information in response to legal processes including,
                        without limitation, in response to a court order or subpoena. We further reserve
                        the right, subject to applicable law, including without limitation, HIPAA and the
                        Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), to use or disclose any User Information,
                        without notice or consent as needed: (i) to third party service providers who provide
                        portions of the Site’s functionality, each of whom have agreed in writing to maintain
                        the confidentiality of the User Information; (ii) to satisfy any law or regulation;
                        (iii) to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law;
                        (iv) to protect the integrity of the Site and our property; (v) to protect visitors
                        to the Site or others; (vi) to ensure the Site is used in conformance with the terms
                        and conditions set forth in the Terms of Use displayed on the Site; or (vii) to
                        the providers to whom you have a financial obligation.
                    </p>
                    <strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong>
                    <p>
                        To enhance your experience on this Site, many of our Web pages use "cookies." Cookies
                        are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies
                        do tell us your e-mail address and other personally identifiable information. We
                        use cookies to improve the content and offerings on the Site. For example, we may
                        use cookies to personalize your experience on the Site (e.g., to recognize you by
                        name when you return to the Site or to maintain session states for you).
                    </p>
                    <strong>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
                    <p>
                        Our employees and service providers are made aware of the Privacy Policy through
                        periodic communications and training. We limit access to private and confidential
                        data to those employees and service providers with a specific need to retrieve this
                        information, and we store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure
                        environments
                    </p>
                    <strong>CHANGES IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE</strong>
                    <p>
                        In developing our business, we might sell certain assets of the Company, or parts
                        of the Company, may be sold, merged, or otherwise transferred. Your information,
                        whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets
                        in such transactions.</p>
                    <strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
                    <p>
                        We will occasionally update the Privacy Policy as necessary to comply with a changing
                        environment. While we will attempt to notify you of material changes to the Privacy
                        Policy, we recommend that you check the Privacy Policy when you visit the Site to
                        be sure you are aware of and understand the current Privacy Policy. We will not
                        make changes in how we handle previously collected personal information that have
                        retroactive effect unless legally required to do so.</p>
